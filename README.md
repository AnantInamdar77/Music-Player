Enhance the user interface by showing player controls (play/pause, volume, next/previous) when hovering over the music player.

Ensure the music player is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
Test and adjust touch events (like swipe gestures) for mobile users.

Integrate with external music services like Spotify, SoundCloud, or YouTube to let users stream their favorite tracks directly within AudioZen.
